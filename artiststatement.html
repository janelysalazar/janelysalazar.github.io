			<h1>Biography</h1>
			<p> Janely Salazar is an independent Latinx Queer artist out of South Central Los Angeles and has exhibited their work in galleries at San Jose State University, the Hammer Theatre, and Martha Street Art Night. Specifically, Janely's recently exhibited bodies of work included Sun Kissed in the Hills, Body Positivity themes in Santa Cruz, and handcrafted wire art pieces throughout the past three years in San Jose, California. 


			Their background is in photography and other art mediums such as painting, drawing, digital media, flow arts, and jewelry making. Their focus through art includes body positivity, abstract themes, aesthetics, various technology mediums, and the LGBTQ+ community. They are also familiar with software programs such as adobe lightroom and photoshop, processing, audacity, sketchfab, and sublime text. In addition, their inspirations come from personal experiences and through advocating to decrease unjust societal influences towards minority communities. Their next upcoming project will be this Summer of 2018, that will focus on documenting the lives of their LGBTQ+ friends who are transitioning and are looking to share their journey and identities. What Janely hopes to achieve through their artwork is to collaborate with other social justice and creative individuals who are looking to share their stories with different art mediums. </p>
